## Overview

Throughout this course, I gained knowledge of the principles of operation of major electronic devices, such as junction diodes, bipolar transistors, and field-effect transistors.

One of the projects I worked on involved analyzing circuits with non-linear elements, such as diodes and transistors, using LT Spice simulation software. I gained an understanding of how to analyze and design simple circuits using operational amplifiers, and I learned about the technologies of integrated circuits, Moore's Law, and basic CMOS digital electronic circuits.

Another project I worked on was the design of amplifiers using a single transistor or multiple transistors. This included analyzing the different transistor biasing networks, generator circuits, and small-signal models. I also gained an understanding of differential amplifiers, as well as how to design and analyze basic applications of operational amplifiers, such as inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, summing amplifiers, integrators, and differentiators.

Through these projects, I also learned about the non-ideal conditions of operational amplifiers, such as input offset currents and voltages, bias currents, limited gain, and frequency limitations. Overall, these projects provided me with a practical understanding of the principles of electronics and the ability to apply these principles to real-world circuit design.
